**Data:**				
Data can be a number, symbol, character, word  without context, Data has no meaning.			
Data Is Raw Facts,Details of a object,etc.,				
Ex:Student test score,With out context we can't make use of this number.			

**Information:**		
Information is Data put into context,Information can be Processed for a particular use.					
Information provides meaning,Information Changes depending on need.				
Ex: Student average marks of a semister.				

**DataBase**				
Database is a Systematic collection of data,organized for better usability.				
Used for easy management and scalability.						
A spreadsheet is a database, each table is a part of a database.		

**CRUD**		
Each DATABASE Engine should be able to perform these operations.		
1. *Create*: Can create new databases,tables 
2. *Read*: Read existing database,tables
3. *Update*: Update the data in the database and tables 
4. *Delete*: Delete data/column/table/database.

These are the Main operations that are performed against a certain database.		
There are many types of databases available.		
Of Them these are the most used database types over the wild.		
**Types**			
1. *Object Oriented:*	Object oriented databases are used to store objects from a programming language directly. These databases supports all object oriented concepts,to make accessing the value from multiple objects effectively.	
2. *Relational:*	Relational database keeps relations between tables and databases.This is the most used and most robust.
	With this method we can have data about a single concept in one place and link it with other databases/tables with relations.
3. *Non-Relational/NoSQL:*	NoSQL is created to mitigate the drawbacks of Relational DATABASE,This stores data as it is given.There is no structure and no schema on how to store the data, this makes for faster storing and retrival times, but slow updating times.		

**Open Source Databases**			
1. *MySQL*:SQL Standard
2. *PostgreSQL*:Popular SQL 
3. *MariaDB*: MySQL Fork
4. *MongoDB*: NoSQL Standard
5. *Redis*: NosQL with key-value pair


**SQL**							
SQL is Structured Query Language,used for manipulating,retrieving data in a relational database.			
SQL database has a structure,schema,is vertical scalable.			

**NoSQL**		
NoSQL is the opposite of SQL,this is used to store and retrive data with no structure and schema.			
Faster to store and retrive data,but slow to update data,horizontal scalable.
